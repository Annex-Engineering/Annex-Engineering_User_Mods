## Afterburner x carriage with magprobe - dual MGN9 rails

![picture](Images/3.JPG)

## What is it?
This modified x carriage integrates a magprobe. Both IGUS and Generic cable chains are supported. A bigger rear exhaust has been realised. This new probe is completely solderless and has many benefits such as actually probing the surface of the buildplate and great repeatability. The dock can be mounted stationary or onto the gantry (See the experimental folder).
For pickup detection probe_query or a circuit with the dock can be made. No buildvolume is lost since the probe can be docked in the 10mm y overtravel of the V2.4
