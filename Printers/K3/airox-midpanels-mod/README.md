# Panels for above your Z-drives

Thanks to pandasticpanda for his initial panel design!

Altered the dimensions a bit and broke it into two pieces so you
can do a neat dual tone design with mountains included.

Benefit of these panels is not having filament going into your z-drives that easily.
It also just looks great. Downside is you loose a bit of Z if your umbilical cables
of the bed are the first thing to touch the panels. 

Needs a few spacers and has caps for the 80t gears so you can make sure you don't
accidently slide in filament when cleaning the bottom. Make sure when you screw on
the caps for the 80t gears you add some loctite within the heat inserts so the cap
stays in place during all the movement of the K3. I used in combination with hammernuts.
So attached the spacers to the panel with screw and hammernuts before placing the panel
within the printer.

Let me know what could be changed to make it even better.
