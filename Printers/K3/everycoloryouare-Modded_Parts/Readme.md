# Various Tweaks to K3 Parts

This folder contains several tweaks to the stock R1.1 K3 parts including:

- Improved printability of mosquito side mount by removing a thin wall around one of the carriage bolts to prevent thin walls during printing.
- 5.5 rail thickness cross rail mounts.
- Bed frame mounts for 8mm dia x 55mm long rods.
- Distribution carabiner mount for the R1.0 ebox that uses two of M3 bolts that secures the back panel to the horizontal extrusion of the frame.
- Improved printability of the k3rabiner sherpa micro mosquito/dragon party plate by adding chamfers around some holes so they don't print in mid air, and thickening a wall to prevent thin walls during printing.
- Added heat set inserts to the mosquito net probe frame brace for both 1.2mm and 1.6mm variants which helps when assembling with the Beacon probe (which has screws mounted from the bottom). M3 nuts are still required to secure the net but is independent of Beacon installation.
- Simplified the XY endstops and the Y min endstops no longer have left and right versions.
