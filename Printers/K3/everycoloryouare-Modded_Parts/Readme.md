# Various Tweaks to K3 Parts

This folder contains several tweaks to stock R1.1 K3 parts including

- Improved printability of mosquito side mount by removing a thin wall around one of the carriage bolts to prevent webbing during printing.
- 5.5 rail thickness cross rail mounts.
- Bed frame mounts for 55mm long rods.
- Distribution carabiner mount for the R1.0 ebox that connects between two of the top row M3 bolts.
- Improved printability of the k3rabiner sherpa micro party plate that adds chambers around some holes so they don't think in mid air, and thickens a wall to prevent webbing during printing.
- Added heat set inserts to the mosquito net probe frame brace for both 1.2mm and 1.6mm variants which helps when assembling with beacon which has screws mounted from the bottom. M3 nuts are still required to secure the net however.
- Simplified the XY endstops and Y min no longer has a left and right version.
