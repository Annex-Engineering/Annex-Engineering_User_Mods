# Various Tweaks to K3 Parts

This folder contains several tweaks to the stock R1.1 K3 parts including:

- Improved printability of mosquito side mount by removing a thin wall around one of the carriage bolts to prevent thin walls during printing.
- 5.5 rail thickness cross rail mounts.
- Bed frame mounts for 8mm Dia x 55mm Length shafts instead of the stock 50mm.
- Distribution carabiner mount for the R1.0 ebox that uses two of the M3 bolts that secures the back panel to the horizontal extrusion of the frame.
- Added heat set inserts to the mosquito net probe frame brace for both 1.2mm and 1.6mm variants which helps when assembling with the Beacon probe (which has screws mounted from the bottom). M3 nuts are still required to secure the net but is independent of Beacon installation.
- Simplified the XY endstops and the Y min endstops no longer have left and right versions.
