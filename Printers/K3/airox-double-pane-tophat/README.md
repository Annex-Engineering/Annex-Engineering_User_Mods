# Double pane tophat

An overkill tophat for the K3 with the possibility to do double or triple panel
with air in between for a bit of extra isolation.

The default setup consists of one bottom panel, a middle panel and a top panel.
It needs quite a large number of heat inserts and M3 bolts.

It's a heavy tophat which is quite sturdy compared to the original tophat.
Hope you like it!
