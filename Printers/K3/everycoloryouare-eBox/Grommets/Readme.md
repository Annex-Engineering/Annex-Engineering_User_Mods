# Modified Grommets and Nuts

A set of grommets variants for routing from the printer through the panels to the electronic box. The different variants are intended to minimize the heat loss through the grommet into the electronic box by limiting the feedthrough gaps. Designs are based on the annex engineering grommets for the K series printers with modified openings, thread profile, and thread diameter.

## Notes

The grommet screws are designed to be flush with the grommet nut once tightened down, and therefore come in two lengths for 2mm and 3mm thick panels. The grommet screws also have a shoulder that should sit with little movement inside a 25mm or 38mm panel hole. The grommet screws come in several variants to suit different use cases:
- 25mm grommet with a 18mm opening for general purpose use.
- 25mm grommet with a split 14mm opening which can fit a wiring harness, PTFE tube, USB cable, and two motor wires bundles.
- 25mm grommet with a split 4mm wide slot which can fit two motor wire bundles in addition to a couple of miscellaneous wires (LEDs, thermistors, etc).
- 38mm grommet with a 26mm open for general purpose use that can fit a 16 pin microfit connector.
- 38mm grommet with a split angled slot that fits a wiring harness, PTFE tube, and a USB cable.

The split grommet screws have no clearances between the sides and some light sanding might be required to have the two halves lay flush and accept the nut.

The grommet nuts come in three variants with 0.05mm, 0.1mm, and 0.2mm clearances between the nut threads and the grommet screw threads.

## Other Variants
Feel free to modify the CAD files to make other variants, or contact @EveryColorYouAre on the Annex Engineering discord to request versions for a particular use case.
